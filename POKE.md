## The Process

### Base

Rice is the most obvious choice here, but it is quite filling. The rice's role in the dish is primarily to mellow out the overt fish taste in the dish and give the diner a break every few bites. So no matter what, rice should be used sparingly. For multiple dishes, it might make sense to use minimal or no rice, and accomplish the rice's job with a larger variety of light ingredients (think seaweed, avacado, mango, etc.) Each bite should offer something a little different. 

### Fish

For a bolder fish, we can go with:
- Tuna
    - Skipjack (Has a nice bold red color, good alternative to bluefin) 
    - Bluefin (The boldest flavor out of any of the tuna varieties. Could be good to pair with Albacore)
- Salmon (The least complex of all of these. Taste still quite strong, but not like a Tuna)
- Mackerel (Horse Mackerel is supposed to be quite good, has a whiter color)

Lighter fish require a lighter hand with seasoning, so prepare accordingly:
- Fluke
- Flounder
- Sea Bass
- Sea Bream

Any of the lighter fish should probably skip many of the more masking oils or marinades. 

### Condiments

Depending on the rest of your meal, the condiments you should serve over your poke will change drastically. f
