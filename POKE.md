# Poke

## The Meal

### Context

When I served this dish, it was nearing the end of summer and starting to transition to fall. I had a rough idea for a fruity (ideally through the use of mango) meal that was on the lighter side. It was 80Â°F out and that meant that the less amount of heat I used, the better. 

I decided that I wanted to do a bold tuna bowl, and the season permitted me my mango, with a simple spicy and refreshing green salad on the side. By adding in the mint, Thai basil, and cilantro to the salad, it gave it an extra refreshing kick, and helped mellow out the salad dressing.

## Background

Poke (pronounced "poh-kay") has an interesting background. The book [*The Food of Paradise: Exploring Hawaii's Culinary Heritage* by Rachel Lauden](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZnsTxepydfQC) goes very briefly into the history of poke, and explains that in truth tracing back the use of the word "poke" to the dish we know and love yields shallow results. That isn't to say, however, that it isn't rooted in history. The concept is incredibly simple and hugely representative of the connection between Hawaiian culture and the sea, and existed well into the history of the Polynesians (albeit without the name "poke"). Simply cut up the fish into bite-sized pieces, sprinkle it with some Hawaiian salt, seaweed, and some prepared kukui nut (Candlenut) meat and you have yourself a fragrant, simple, and delicious meal. 

It's only been in the [last few years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poke_(fish_salad)#History) that poke on the mainland has exploded. This new trend concerns itself with plating the fish properly, or making sure the type of fish is the most superb. In contrast, the traditional dish was often prepared by rolling the fish right off the cutting board into a bowl, and [often even used cheaper, coastside fish](http://firstwefeast.com/eat/2016/03/hawaii-chef-has-problems-with-poke-trend). This writeup of the poke popularity from a Hawaiian chef is really interesting and worth a read: http://firstwefeast.com/eat/2016/03/hawaii-chef-has-problems-with-poke-trend

All this is to say that you shouldn't overthink it. Go for something that tastes good, but keep in mind that at the heart of the dish and it's history, it's about the fish and the sea and shouldn't probably deviate too far from that. Dishes don't usually survive getting passed down from generation to generation if they aren't versatile and delicious.

## The Process

### Base

Rice is the most obvious choice here, but it is quite filling. The rice's role in the dish is primarily to mellow out the overt fish taste in the dish and give the diner a break every few bites. So no matter what, rice should be used sparingly. For multiple dishes, it might make sense to use minimal or no rice, and accomplish the rice's job with a larger variety of light ingredients (think seaweed, avacado, mango, etc.) Each bite should offer something a little different. 

### Fish

For a bolder fish, we can go with:
- Tuna
    - Skipjack (Has a nice bold red color, good alternative to bluefin) 
    - Bluefin (The boldest flavor out of any of the tuna varieties. Could be good to pair with Albacore)
- Salmon (The least complex of all of these. Taste still quite strong, but not like a Tuna)
- Mackerel (Horse Mackerel is supposed to be quite good, has a whiter color)

Lighter fish require a lighter hand with seasoning, so prepare accordingly:
- Fluke
- Flounder
- Sea Bass
- Sea Bream

Any of the lighter fish should probably skip many of the more masking oils or marinades. 

### Condiments

The condiments and toppings should adapt and mesh to provide a cohesive experience with not just the fish and the base, but the rest of the meal. Additionally, consider the season: Is it the end of summer? The beginning of spring? Base your condiments around seasonal ingredients to elevate the dish. 

As a general philosophy that I adhear to, the purpose of the condiments are to elevate the fish. Raw fish is often delicate in its taste, and unique. That means avoiding clashing flavors and not overdoing any of the seasonings. _Especially_ be light handed when marinading. A simple mix of some sesame oil and soy sauce can do the trick for the fish.

Here's some of my favorite condiments:
- Mango (Should be ripe, but not overly so. Needs to hold form and not melt in the bowl)
- Seaweed Salad (I grabbed mine from the same Japanese market I got my fish)
- Sesame Seeds
- Cilantro
- Soy Sauce
- Honey (Blend this with an oil for a sweet flavor if mango or something akin is not suitable)
- Scallions
